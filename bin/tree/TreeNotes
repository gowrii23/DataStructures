//Tree cannot contains cycles
//has only 2 children per node
//Node is called as leaf if it has no children

Binary tree vs binary search tree
=================================
binary search tree -- follows ordering property
all left descendents <= n < all right descendents

hint - duplicate may or may no allowed as per interviewer

Always ask interviewer its a Binary tree or BST


Balanced tree
=============
ensure insert and find are O(log n)

Complete BT
===========
Every level is fully filled, atleast left to Right


Full Binary Tree
================
Every node has 2 or 0 children

Perfect Binary Tree
===================
Both full and complete


InOrder
=======
L, root, R

Pre Order
=========
root, L, R

Post Order
==========
L, R, root
